                        <p>I started to be interested in technology when I was 16 years old. I studied what I liked, in this field I felt suitable and wanted to know more and more. Of course there were obstacles when studying it, but that was one of the processes for me to develop better.<br></p>
                        
                        <p>So, let's motivate ourselves to fight laziness, lack of confidence and fear of starting something. It is better to fail and improve than not to fail but have never done something.<br></p>

                            <p>But I want to start determining my choice, and I choose the world of programming. In studying a lot of materials I get a lot of things, train my patience, and think critically in solving problems in my code. But that's the most fun part. Like this Personal Website that I built from the knowledge I learned. Many errors that I have solved, and will continue to learn, learn and learn. Because technology will never stop improve.<br></p>

                            <p>In 2023, I was selected as one of the students in PASKIBRAKA to commemorate Indonesia's 78th anniversary. Here I was trained, forged, and given a lot of knowledge about discipline. I am very happy because I got that experience, new friends, new knowledge, and new good and healthy habits.<br></p>

                            <p>There are many part competed in FLS2N, but one of them that I participated in is Kriya Arts. Making art that is made manually by hand. Here I learned a lot of lessons, Art is not only aesthetic, but also useful and beneficial for human life. I continued to practice for 1 month, but because my efforts were still not enough, I could not win. But I am grateful to be able to participate in this event because I got a lot of knowledge and friends.<br></p>
